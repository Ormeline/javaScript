//Exercise 1
//In the node REPL (type node in terminal), declare two variables â€” a with value 4 and b with value 6.
//Using console.log, print the result of:
//a + b (should print 10)
//a * b (should print 24)

//Welcome to Node.js v20.2.0.
//Type ".help" for more information.
//> a = 4
//4
//> a = 4; b = 6 
//6
//> console.log(a + b )
//10
//undefined
//> console.log(a * b);
//24

//Can you find the problem in the following program? Make the fix, so the code prints "Hello Makers" when run into node.

//const greeting = 'Hello ';
//const name = 'Makers';

//> console.log greeting + name;
//console.log(greeting + name);
            ^^^^^^^^

//Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'greeting'

//greeting has already been declared (it's a constant variable), to fix the issue
//we would have to type 
//console.log(greeting + name ); this will print Hello Makers
